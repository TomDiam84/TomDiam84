My name is Thomas Diamantis. I have a master's degree in Computer Science and IT Applications from the University of West Attica in Athens, Greece. During my studies but also as self-motivated, I have developed small and large projects using Java, php and javaScript. I have also dealt with C, Python, Assembly, html5, CSS3 and SQL. As my most important contributions so far I consider two: (a) An educational application for learning Python (in Greek) with android mobile devices, which I developed using Java and (b) an online product auction website made with php, mysql, html5, CSS3 and javaScript, which I am still working on.
